# MoonPhase

Basic C program that is running in a linux environment. This program tells me the current moon phase at my location.  Utilizes the Raspberry pi's gpio pins, wired up to 4 LEDs, to show me the 8 phases to the moon. 

## Some stuff I learned

Embedded system on Pi 

Threading in Linux C 

Pulse width modulation 

Moon life cycle is about 29.5 days
